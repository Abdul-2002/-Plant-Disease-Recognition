This model will predict any disease a plant might have.
Plant Disease Prediction using PlantVillage Dataset
This project aims to predict plant diseases using the PlantVillage dataset. The PlantVillage dataset is a large collection of images of diseased and healthy plants, covering various crop species and diseases.

Dataset
The PlantVillage dataset contains thousands of images of plant leaves, categorized into different classes based on the type of disease or health status. The dataset provides a valuable resource for training machine learning models to classify and predict plant diseases.

You can access the PlantVillage dataset from the official website: plantvillage.org.

Project Structure
The project has the following structure:

data/: This directory contains the dataset images divided into train and test sets.
models/: This directory contains saved models or checkpoints.
notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
src/: This directory contains the source code for the project, including data loading, model architecture, and prediction functions.
requirements.txt: This file lists the required Python packages for running the project.
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-prediction.git
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
cd plant-disease-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Preprocess the dataset:
Use the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to preprocess the dataset. This may include resizing images, splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and augmenting the data for better model performance.

Train the model:
Run the training notebook to train a model on the preprocessed dataset. The notebook will save the trained model or checkpoints in the models/ directory.

Evaluate the model:
Use the evaluation notebook to assess the performance of the trained model on the test set. The notebook will provide metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Predict plant diseases:
To predict diseases for new plant images, you can use the provided prediction functions in the src/ directory. These functions load the trained model and return the predicted disease class for a given image.
